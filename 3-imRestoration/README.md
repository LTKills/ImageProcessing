# Image Restoration

Deblurring and denoising of images using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Currently this program only deals with images in grayscale.

## Usage

## Contributing

There is a bunch of stuff that could be done:

1. Figure out the best parameters/kernel to filter a given image, as to allow usage by lay users

2. Use python's [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to create a command line utility.

3. Enhance README (include example images, explain the Fourier Transform)

4. Document code (how to use it properly)

5. Other ideas?
